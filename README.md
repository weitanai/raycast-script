## Install Script Commands from this repository

To install new commands, follow these steps:

1. Choose a script from the [community repo](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/commands#apps) and save it into a new directory.
   
   Scripts containing the word `.template.` in the filename require some values to be set (check [the troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-and-faqs) for more information).
   
   Alternatively, instead of creating a new directory you can reuse the repo's [`_enable-commands` folder](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/_enabled-commands).
3. Open the Extensions tab in the Raycast preferences
4. Click the plus button
5. Click `Add Script Directory`
6. Select directories containing your Script Commands

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** We recommend that you don't directly load the community script directories into Raycast to avoid potential restructuring and new script commands suddenly appearing in Raycast.



## Create your own Script Commands

To write your own custom Script Commands, go over the following steps:

1. Use the `Create Script Command` functionality in Raycast
2. Write and edit your script using your favourite code editor
3. Run your Script Command from the Raycast root search

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** If you choose to write your script in `Bash`, we highly recommend using the [Shellcheck](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck) linter as this will ensure smooth running of your script. All  scripts uploaded to GitHub will need to have been run through ShellCheck.
